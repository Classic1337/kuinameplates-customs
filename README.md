Kui_Nameplates-Customs
======================
A collection of custom.lua scripts and patches for Kui_Nameplates.

How do I what is how what is even how what?
-------------------------------------------

Download [Kui_Nameplates_Custom.zip](https://github.com/kesava-wow/kuinameplates-customs/raw/master/Kui_Nameplates_Custom.zip) and install it like any other addon. Then, click on one of the custom.\*.lua files in the list above, click "raw" at the top right of its code, download that into the Kui_Nameplates_Custom folder you just installed, and rename it to custom.lua, ignoring the template file.

Note that if you want to use more than one of these modifications at a time, you'll need to either manually merge the scripts, or add more files to the Kui_Nameplates_Custom.toc list.
